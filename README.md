## Streamlit App Demo

This project demonstrates how to embed a machine learning model into a graphical user interface (GUI) using Streamlit. The goal is to create an interactive interface for sales prediction, catering to consumers and other stakeholders. The app was developed as part of the Azubi Africa Data Science Training.

## Features

**Sales Prediction**: The app allows users to input the date, store number, and product family to get a sales prediction using a pre-trained XGBoost model.
**Interactive Interface**: Streamlit provides an easy-to-use, web-based interface for users to interact with the model and get predictions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

* Streamlit
* pandas
